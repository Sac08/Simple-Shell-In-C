# Simple-Shell-In-C
  
    A command line Shell, which is mainly developed to understand the process in linux (how it forks, and how command
    runs over child process). it is purely developed in C programming language inorder to increase learning curve (comp-
    -ared to C many programming languaes offers built-in function, thus declining learning opportunity.)
